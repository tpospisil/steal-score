# Steal Score

## Setup

### Dependencies

I highly recommend using [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/) as your version manager (with [`asdf-ruby`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-ruby)) so you don't have to deal with the pain that inevitably comes with trying to use `rvm` or `rbenv`.

Once installed, install `ruby-3.4.1`
```
asdf install ruby 3.4.1`
```

Install ruby gems using `bundler`
```
bundle install
```
